8mylez Bewerbung Philipp Link  - Coding Case: Developer mit Schwerpunkt Storefront - JavaScript

This is a Plugin Theme build for Shopware 6 with the use of Visual Studio Code and Docker as a container host.
It uses twig (HTML), SCSS (CSS) and ECMAScript 6 (JavaScript) in a Symfony Framework.

===

With this Plugin you can choose to add some extra Feedback when an user adds a product to the shopping cart.
For a short period of time the color of the "Add to shopping cart" button changes and also the text will animate in a way that the user knows that his request is in progress.

For the developer it is possible to change the color of the animation in the backend of shopware6 at the plugin configurations.
